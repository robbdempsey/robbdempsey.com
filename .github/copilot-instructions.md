# Project Overview

This project is a personal website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, which displays details about my career and interests. Quality of the language used in the website is a top priority, as it reflects my communication skills and professionalism. SEO optimization is also crucial to ensure the website ranks well in search engine results, making it easily discoverable by potential employers and collaborators.

## Project Structure

`./src` - Contains all the source code for the website
`./public` - Contains static assets like images and fonts
`./.spec` - Contains specification files for features and research topics
`./.issues` - Contains issue templates and feature requests
`./.github` - Contains GitHub-specific files like workflows and copilot instructions

## Code Style

- Always provide examples in TypeScript.
- use functional programing patterns.
- spec file naming convention v<semantic version>-< feature/research topic >.spec.md
- spec semantic version should follow the current package.json version


## Things to do

- read the appropriate instructions before modifying any code.
- think about the problem you have been asked to solve.
- when asked HOW something works or HOW to accomplish a task use the code-analyzer to help you understand the codebase.
