# Codebase Overview Analysis

## Analysis: robbdempsey.com Personal Website

### Overview
This is a personal website for Robb Dempsey, a full-stack engineer, built using Next.js 14 with the App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The site displays professional information including career history, skills, and personal interests, with a focus on SEO optimization and responsive design. It uses static site generation for deployment and includes dark mode support.

### Entry Points
- `src/app/layout.tsx:1` - Root layout component wrapping all pages
- `src/app/page.tsx:1` - Homepage displaying introduction and photo gallery
- `src/app/about/page.tsx:1` - About page with personal background
- `src/app/work/page.tsx:1` - Work experience page with tabbed contract/FTE roles
- `src/app/not-found.tsx:1` - 404 error page

### Core Implementation

#### 1. Application Structure (`src/app/layout.tsx:1-32`)
- Defines root metadata with title template and description
- Wraps content in Providers component for theme management
- Uses Layout component for consistent page structure
- Applies global CSS and font settings

#### 2. Theme Management (`src/app/providers.tsx:1-50`)
- Client-side component managing theme state with next-themes
- Implements system theme detection and synchronization
- Provides AppContext for previous pathname tracking
- Uses ThemeWatcher to handle OS theme changes

#### 3. Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx:1-75`)
- Server component rendering introduction text and social links
- Displays rotating photo gallery using Next.js Image optimization
- Includes hardcoded photos with responsive sizing
- Social links to GitHub and LinkedIn

#### 4. Navigation System (`src/components/Header.tsx:1-300`)
- Client component with complex scroll-based animations
- Implements mobile and desktop navigation variants
- Uses Headless UI Popover for mobile menu
- Avatar scaling and positioning based on scroll position
- Navigation links sourced from `src/lib/navLinks.ts`

#### 5. Work Experience Display (`src/components/WorkContent.tsx:1-25`)
- Client component managing tab state between contract and FTE work
- Renders WorkSection components for each role
- Uses Tabs component for switching between work types
- Data sourced from `src/lib/work.ts`

#### 6. Work Section Rendering (`src/components/WorkSection.tsx:1-50`)
- Displays individual work roles using Card component
- Shows company as section title, role details in card format
- Handles duration formatting differently for contract vs FTE roles
- Lists technologies in sorted, comma-separated format

### Data Flow
1. User navigates to route, Next.js App Router matches page component
2. Layout wraps page with providers and theme context
3. Header renders navigation based on current pathname
4. Page components render content using shared components
5. Work data flows from lib files through WorkContent to individual sections
6. Images are optimized via Next.js Image component with responsive sizing

### Key Patterns
- **Component Composition**: Reusable components like Container, Card, Button
- **Data Separation**: Business data in lib files (work.ts, navLinks.ts)
- **Client/Server Split**: Server components for static content, client for interactivity
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for data structures (Role, NavLinkItem)

### Configuration
- Next.js config enables MDX support with remark/rehype plugins
- Static export enabled for deployment without server
- Tailwind config extends typography plugin with custom styles
- Custom font sizes defined in tailwind.config.ts
- Image optimization disabled for static export

### Error Handling
- 404 page provides user-friendly error message with home link
- TypeScript strict mode catches type errors at compile time
- Next.js handles routing errors automatically

### Dependencies
- Next.js 14 for React framework with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling with typography plugin
- Headless UI for accessible components
- Next-themes for theme management
- MDX support for potential blog content
- Sharp for image processing

### Build and Deployment
- Static site generation via `next build` and `next export`
- Scripts configured for development, build, and start
- Images unoptimized for static hosting compatibility
- Trailing slashes enabled for static file serving

### Styling Architecture
- Tailwind utility classes for responsive design
- Dark mode support via CSS variables and selector
- Custom typography styles in typography.ts
- Consistent color palette with zinc/teal theme
- Ring borders and backdrop blur for modern aesthetics

### Performance Optimizations
- Next.js Image component with priority loading for hero images
- Static generation reduces server load
- Code splitting via Next.js automatic optimization
- Font optimization through next/font (implied by antialiased class)

This implementation follows Next.js best practices with clean separation of concerns, type safety, and responsive design focused on professional presentation of career information.
